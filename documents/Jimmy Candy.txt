Summary
Behavioral Objective: The subject of the group session was focused on supporting clients in
maintaining remission from substance use, specifically addressing triggers and relapse
prevention strategies. Psychoeducation was integrated by discussing the importance of
self-awareness, accountability, and acknowledging past behaviors as part of the recovery
process. The goal of the group was to reinforce positive behavioral changes and promote
sustained abstinence, while providing a supportive environment for sharing progress and
challenges.
Data: The client, Jimmy Candy, was observed to be in remission and has demonstrated
significant effort in abstaining from substance use, specifically referring to substances as
'candy,' 'speed,' and 'juices.' He has acknowledged his past behaviors and is working towards
positive change. The client appeared to be in a good mental and emotional state during the
session. No acute distress or negative symptoms were reported or observed.
Assessment: Jimmy Candy is making notable progress towards his treatment goals,
particularly in the area of sustained abstinence from substances. His acknowledgment of past
behaviors and commitment to positive change are indicative of increased insight and
motivation for recovery. No immediate risk factors for relapse, self-harm, or harm to others
were identified during this session. Continued monitoring for relapse risk is recommended,
but current presentation is stable and positive.
ASAM Level: Based on current presentation and progress, client appears to meet criteria for
ASAM Level 1 (Outpatient Services), as he is demonstrating stability and effective
engagement in treatment with no acute withdrawal or biomedical complications noted.
Plan: Continue with current outpatient treatment plan. Next session to be scheduled as per
routine. Encourage client to maintain current strategies for abstinence and self-reflection. No
changes to treatment plan at this time. Monitor for any emerging risk factors or changes in
status in future sessions.
